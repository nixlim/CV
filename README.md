## Igor Ryabchuk

[Profiles](#profiles)


Ever curious tinkerer, aspiring software crafter and seeker of problems in need of solving. I have managed implementation of multi-million dollar deals, sparred with High Court judges and have been conquered by two mischievous kids.  

I am afraid of stale environments, where brains go to die and wits find their end, where all challenge is gone and has been replaced by dreary sameness. I want to keep learning, finding new ways of doing, working and learning, and having a continuous supply of challenges that need facing, solving and, as necessary, overcoming. If, in the process, I could help make this world better - that would be great.

Oh, and I like to break and adapt stuff just to see how it works. It tends to work out with software. I kept on burning the hardware so I had to stop messing with that.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail

I headed several legal due diligence exercises in preparation for regulatory listings, identifying and assisting corporate clients to resolve potentially deal-breaking issues. This involved detailed analysis of thousands of pages of legal documentation as well as intricate understanding of clients' businesses and strategic goals. I am the guy who spots that missing ";" in your code.

Some of the projects I was involved in:

- Parallel Market IPO Launch (Saudi Arabia) [Link](https://www.shearman.com/news-and-events/news/2017/02/parallel-market-of-the-saudi-stock-exchange)
- Second-largest Rights Issue on Saudi Stock Exchange [Link](https://www.shearman.com/news-and-events/news/2016/09/saudi-rights-issue)

#### Quick learner, self-starter

I tend to pick things up fairly quickly and I like to prepare ahead whenever possible. I picked up the details of Saudi legal system within a couple of months and started learning about it prior to actually taking up the post.

I also learned how to build web apps with Java and Spring in about a week as part of a team that delivered the project in 5 days.

#### Focused under pressure

I can maintain focus and concentration over prolonged periods of time as and when required. I have consistently achieved billing targets while delivering quality work and meeting deadlines. 

#### Consummate researcher

Not only can I Google well, I actually tend to find the right answers.

#### Good manager and team player

I have organised, directed, managed and worked within teams carrying out complex legal transactions, measuring progress and reporting to clients and higher management.

I was part of the management team in charge of the Saudi jurisdiction part of multi-million dollar energy sector merger. My responsibilities included organising teams, preparing detailed project plans and implementing systems for measuring and managing progress across several jurisdictions. I reported directly to the Head of Corporate for the region.
