## Igor Ryabchuk

Ever curious tinkerer, aspiring software crafter and seeker of problems in need of solving. I have managed implementation of multi-million dollar deals, sparred with High Court judges and have been conquered by two mischievous kids.  

I am afraid of stale environments, where brains go to die and wits find their end, where all challenge is gone and has been replaced by dreary sameness. I want to keep learning, finding new ways of doing, working and learning, and having a continuous supply of challenges that need facing, solving and, as necessary, overcoming. If, in the process, I could help make this world better - that would be great.

Oh, and I like to break and adapt stuff just to see how it works. It tends to work out with software. I kept on burning hardware so I had to stop messing with that.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail

I headed several legal due diligence exercises in preparation for regulatory listings, identifying and assisting clients to resolve potentially deal breaking issues. This involved detailed analysis of thousands of pages of legal documentation as well as intricate understanding of clients' businesses and strategic goals. I am the guy who spots that missing ";" in your code.

#### Quick learner, self-starter

I tend to pick things up fairly quickly and I like to prepare ahead whenever possible. I picked up the details of Saudi legal system within a couple of months and started learning about it prior to actually taking up the post.

I also learned [STUFF AT THE MAKERS ACADEMY AT AN AMAZING SPEED, you would not really believe me if I told you - to be filled in later.]

I can maintain focus and concentration over prolonged periods of time as and when required. I have consistently achieved billing targets while delivering quality work and meeting deadlines. 

#### Consummate researcher

Not only can I Google well, I actually tend to find the right answers.

#### Good manager and team player

I have organised, directed, managed and worked within teams carrying out complex legal transactions, measuring progress and reporting to clients and higher management.
